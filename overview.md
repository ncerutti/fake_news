# Agent-Based Model of Misinformation Impact on Investment Allocation

## Introduction and Background  
Misinformation – from fake news to organized denial campaigns – can significantly sway public beliefs, with tangible consequences for markets and policy. For example, climate change misinformation has stalled climate action in countries like Australia, **“paralysed policy, clogged investment”** and delayed the transition to cleaner energy ([Australia wasted decades in climate denial – and must break free of the mire of misinformation | Lenore Taylor | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/16/australia-wasted-decades-in-climate-denial-and-must-break-free-of-the-mire-of-misinformation#:~:text=A%20ustralia%E2%80%99s%20climate%20%E2%80%9Cdebate%E2%80%9D%20has,power%20prices%20and%20delayed%20change)). Despite overwhelming scientific evidence, a notable share of the public remains unconvinced; a recent AI-driven analysis found that nearly **15% of Americans deny that climate change is real**, influenced by social media narratives ([AI study finds nearly 15% of Americans deny climate change is real, shaped by social media influencers: Public figures such as Trump play outsized role in influencing beliefs](https://seas.umich.edu/news/ai-study-finds-nearly-15-americans-deny-climate-change-real-shaped-social-media-influencers#:~:text=ANN%20ARBOR%E2%80%93Using%20social%20media%20data,that%20climate%20change%20is%20real)). Such belief distortions can spill into financial behavior: if investors underestimate climate risks due to false narratives (e.g. *climate denialism*), their portfolio choices may skew towards carbon-intensive assets. This research proposes an **agent-based model (ABM)** to explore how exposure to fake news – particularly climate denial – impacts investment portfolio allocation. The model distinguishes **two types of investors**: (1) *individual investors* driven by personal beliefs and biases, and (2) *institutional investors* guided more by broad market sentiment (which itself may be shaped by individuals’ collective beliefs). By simulating their interactions, we aim to understand how misinformation-fueled belief shifts could lead to systemic misallocations (e.g. overinvestment in fossil fuels) and what dynamics emerge at the market level.

## Core Idea and Model Expectations  
**Core Concept:** The model centers on the feedback loop between **beliefs and investment decisions**. Individual agents form beliefs about critical issues (e.g. the reality and risk of climate change) and allocate their portfolios accordingly – for instance, an agent who believes climate change is a hoax might overweight fossil fuel stocks, whereas a believer might favor renewable energy or ESG funds. Institutional agents, in turn, respond to the aggregate market sentiment (the prevailing “wisdom” reflected by the crowd of individuals). If misinformation (like climate denial content) spreads and **shifts individual beliefs**, the expectation is a **market-wide tilt in allocations** – potentially manifesting as **overexposure to high-carbon assets** and underinvestment in sustainable alternatives. We anticipate several emergent outcomes: 

- **Mispricing and Risk Build-Up:** Widespread false beliefs can inflate certain asset values **beyond fundamental value**, akin to a bubble. Prior studies in behavioral finance show that when non-rational traders dominate, prices can **deviate significantly from fundamentals**, allowing irrational strategies to yield excess returns ([Hiroshi Takahashi and Takao Terano: Investors' Behavior in 
Financial Markets
](https://www.jasss.org/6/3/3.html#:~:text=the%20traded%20price%20largely%20deviates,extremely%20high%20or%20in%20the)). In our context, if many agents dismiss climate risks, carbon-intensive assets may be overvalued (a potential “carbon bubble”). This aligns with real-world concerns that ignoring climate reality could impose huge future losses – e.g. one analysis warns that inadequate climate-adjusted beliefs could cut portfolio values by *50–60%* under severe warming scenarios ([Catching up with reality: Investment beliefs need a rethink - Top1000funds.com](https://www.top1000funds.com/2024/08/catching-up-with-reality-investment-beliefs-need-a-rethink/#:~:text=In%202022%20TAI%20published%20a,60%20per%20cent)).

- **Belief Polarity and Market Segmentation:** Agents may split into subpopulations (e.g. *climate deniers* vs *climate-concerned*), each gravitating toward different asset classes. This could create segmented market behavior or volatility as these groups react differently to news. If belief-driven trading is strong, we might see frequent reallocations (high **investment churn**) as agents adjust to each new rumor or outcome. Indeed, individual investors often **over-trade** when driven by sentiment – the most active traders churn their portfolios ~2.5 times per year ([[PDF] The Behavior of Individual Investors - Meet the Berkeley-Haas Faculty](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers%20current%20versions/behavior%20of%20individual%20investors.pdf#:~:text=,more%20than%20twice%20per%20year)) – so a misinformed environment could amplify such turnover.

- **Reinforcement of Beliefs through Outcomes:** We expect feedback whereby short-term portfolio performance can reinforce or challenge beliefs. For example, if climate skeptics overweight oil stocks and oil prices rally, their success may **entrench their denial beliefs** (a false validation), whereas a sudden fossil fuel downturn (perhaps from a new climate policy or disaster) could trigger belief revision. The model can test if market outcomes naturally *correct* misinformation-driven misallocations or if feedback loops instead deepen the belief inertia.

Ultimately, the core hypothesis is that **exposure to fake news will shift investor beliefs in a way that propagates through the market**, potentially causing systemic biases like **overexposure to stranded assets** (e.g. fossil fuels) and greater volatility. The ABM will allow us to observe these dynamics and under what conditions they are mitigated or exacerbated.

## Investor Types and Belief Dynamics  
**Individual Investors:** These agents make allocation decisions heavily influenced by their personal beliefs and biases. In the model, each individual has an internal state representing their belief on a topic (e.g. a confidence that climate change is real and risky). Fake news exposure can alter this state – for instance, a climate-denial article might decrease an individual’s belief in climate risk. Individuals then translate their beliefs into portfolio choices. For example, an individual with low belief in climate change might allocate a larger fraction of their portfolio to coal, oil, or industries deemed at climate risk (underestimating potential future losses), while someone with strong climate concern might favor tech or renewable energy stocks even if short-term returns lag. This captures the behavioral observation that investors often let personal values or misperceptions drive decisions, sometimes to their detriment. The model will incorporate **heterogeneity** in individual traits: some may be more susceptible to misinformation, some more cautious or evidence-driven. We may also include *confirmation bias* (agents giving more weight to information aligning with their prior belief), which can lead to polarized clusters of believers and deniers.

**Institutional Investors:** These agents (e.g. pension funds, banks, mutual funds) are modeled as more influenced by **overall market sentiment and performance** than by personal ideology. Rather than having a fixed personal belief about (say) climate change, an institution might gauge the “mood” of the market or the prevailing trend. For instance, if a majority of individuals are bullish on fossil fuels (perhaps due to widespread climate denial narratives), market prices and sentiment will reflect that optimism – an institution might then increase its fossil-fuel exposure not because its managers disbelieve climate science, but because *“that’s where the market enthusiasm is.”* In effect, institutions in the model perform a kind of trend-following or rational herding: they allocate capital based on signals like price momentum, popular investment themes, or indices that themselves have been influenced by individual investors’ biased decisions. This mechanism reflects real behavior; institutions often chase what they perceive as **collective investor sentiment**, especially in the short run (a dynamic reminiscent of Keynes’ “beauty contest” analogy). However, institutions could also serve as a stabilizing force in some scenarios – for example, if they possess better information or risk management, they might counteract extreme mispricings (e.g. quietly divesting from overvalued fossil assets anticipating long-term risk, even while publicly sentiment is euphoric). The model can be configured to explore both possibilities. Importantly, institutions might amplify misinformation effects if they simply mirror the misinformed crowd, **validating the trend**; conversely, if some institutions buck the trend (for instance, ESG-focused funds avoiding carbon despite denialist sentiment), they introduce an opposing pressure. We will thus represent institutions with rules tied to market aggregates (like average belief or asset price levels) and potentially a diversity of strategies (some momentum-driven, some fundamental-driven) to see how each responds to a misinformation-swayed market.

## Extended Dimensions: Beyond Climate Denialism  
While climate denial is our primary case study, the framework can be generalized to other forms of **economic misinformation** or related phenomena that influence investment behavior. We outline several additional dimensions and scenarios that could be explored:

- **Economic Misinformation & Conspiracy Theories:** Fake news about economic conditions (for example, false reports of an impending recession or conspiracy theories about central bank actions) could drive investors to preemptively reallocate portfolios. An ABM scenario might involve rumors about inflation or currency collapse spreading through the agent network, leading to irrational rushes into gold, crypto, or other assets. This can be compared to factual scenarios to see how misinformation-induced panic or complacency affects market stability. Past market incidents show that even false information can move markets – e.g. a hacked news tweet about a non-existent White House explosion briefly wiped out $130 billion in stock value before correction ([False White House tweet exposes instant trading dangers - Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/false-white-house-tweet-exposes-instant-trading-dangers-idUSBRE93M1FE/#:~:text=False%20White%20House%20tweet%20exposes,Barack%20Obama%20had%20been%20injured)), underscoring the need to understand such dynamics.

- **ESG Backlash and Policy Narratives:** In some regions, there’s a politicized backlash against Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) investing, often fueled by misinformation calling ESG a “fraud” or “woke agenda.” This can lead to institutional mandates that ignore or downplay climate risks. For instance, recent anti-ESG laws (as seen in some U.S. states) pushed institutional portfolios to exclude climate-conscious considerations, resulting in **financial costs** to those states (e.g. Texas’s anti-ESG policy was estimated to add ~$270 million per year in extra bond interest ([
        Texas lawmakers, Houston controller say anti-ESG law is government overreach | S&P Global
    ](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2024/10/texas-lawmakers-houston-controller-say-anti-esg-law-is-government-overreach-83371504#:~:text=state%20have%20paid%20%24270%20million,was%20enacted%20three%20years%20ago))). The model could simulate a scenario where a certain fraction of institutional agents are *constrained* or *biased* by an ESG backlash narrative – for example, they categorically avoid “green” investments or double down on fossil fuel investments regardless of performance. This tests how politicized beliefs at the institutional level (perhaps top-down imposed) interact with individual investor beliefs and market outcomes.

- **Greenwashing and Corporate Misinformation:** Another dimension is the influence of **greenwashing** – companies misrepresenting their environmental performance. Misleading sustainability reports or ads (a form of disinformation) might attract both individual and institutional investors under false pretenses. The ABM can include assets whose “true” properties differ from their perceived ones. For example, a firm claims to be transitioning to clean energy, leading many agents to invest in it, but in reality it’s continuing business-as-usual (a disconnect that might eventually be revealed). This allows exploration of market reactions when truth emerges. Empirical evidence shows investors do care: when companies are caught greenwashing, they suffer an **immediate stock price penalty** (~−0.6% abnormal return on disclosure, with heightened short-term volatility) ([Greenwashing: Do Investors, Markets, and Boards Really Care? | CLS Blue Sky Blog](https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2024/11/07/greenwashing-do-investors-markets-and-boards-really-care/#:~:text=To%20investigate%20the%20effects%20of,face%20heightened%20volatility%20and%20significant)). Our model can replicate such events by switching an asset’s status from “green” to “dirty” mid-simulation and observing portfolio shifts and possible loss cascades for agents who were misled.

- **Hype-driven Bubbles (Meme Stocks and Beyond):** Although not exactly “misinformation” in the malicious sense, social-media-driven investment frenzies (e.g. meme stocks or crypto hype) share similar dynamics: viral narratives drive beliefs that may be disconnected from fundamentals. Extensions of the model could simulate a *meme stock* scenario where a narrative (true or false) about a certain asset spreads among individuals, leading to momentum trading. This helps generalize the framework to study how *any* rapidly diffusing narrative (including false or exaggerated ones) can cause herding, bubbles, and crashes. It also introduces the role of **network structure** (as meme stock communities form online) in amplifying such effects.

Each of these extensions would use the same underlying ABM but tweak the “belief” in question (climate risk, recession rumor, ESG virtue, corporate honesty, etc.) and the information propagation process. By comparing scenarios, we could identify which types of misinformation pose the greatest threat to portfolio stability and under what conditions (e.g. a climate denial campaign vs. a macroeconomic myth). This makes the model broadly useful for exploring **belief-driven market anomalies** beyond the climate focus.

## Model Structure and Interaction Dynamics  

To capture the interplay of beliefs, misinformation, and investment decisions, the ABM will incorporate several key structural components and logic rules. Below we describe potential model structures and interactions:

### Belief Representation and Updating Rules  
Each agent (individual or institutional) will have a **belief state** that influences its decisions. For climate denialism, this could be a continuous scale (e.g. 0 = fully denies climate risk, 1 = fully acknowledges climate risk) or a binary state (denier vs believer) for simplicity. The model will include **belief-updating rules** that determine how an agent’s belief changes over time with new information. Several approaches can be implemented and compared:  

- **Bayesian Updating:** Agents treat new information (news articles, social media posts, etc.) as signals and update their belief in a Bayesian manner. For example, an agent moderately concerned about climate change receives a piece of denialist fake news; if the agent deems the source credible, they lower their belief in climate risk by some factor proportional to the signal strength. Conversely, credible pro-climate news would raise their belief. Bayesian agents would weigh information by prior confidence and assumed reliability of the source. This approach provides a normative baseline for belief updating under uncertainty.  

- **Heuristic or Biased Updating:** Real humans often use simpler heuristics. We might implement **confirmation bias**, where agents give higher weight to information that aligns with their current belief and discount contradictory information. For instance, a climate skeptic exposed to a denial article might amplify their skepticism significantly, but if shown a scientific report on climate, might change only marginally (or even dismiss it outright). Another rule could be **threshold models** (from social influence theory) where an agent switches belief state only if a certain fraction of their peers hold the opposing belief or if a cumulative credibility threshold is passed.  

- **Inertia and Reinforcement:** Agents could have inertia in beliefs – requiring multiple exposures to change state – and beliefs could strengthen (move toward extremes) when repeatedly confirmed. An agent continuously bombarded with one-sided misinformation might drift toward the extreme end of that belief (e.g. become an ardent denier). The model might include a decay for belief change over time (if no new misinformation arrives, perhaps some agents drift back toward a moderate stance, especially if real-world cues contradict their false belief).  

Overall, these rules will let us experiment with different psychological assumptions. A key design is that **fake news injection** (through the diffusion process below) will serve as an exogenous shock to beliefs. We expect to observe phenomena like **polarization** (clusters of agents reinforcing each other’s views) and possibly **belief echo chambers**, depending on how we configure the social network and updating (e.g. confirmation bias + homophily in the network could lead to self-reinforcing communities of deniers and of believers).

### Misinformation Diffusion through Networks  
To simulate fake news exposure, the model will include a representation of how information spreads among agents. We will likely use a **social network structure** connecting individuals (nodes are investors, edges represent social/media connections). Potential diffusion mechanisms:  

- **Broadcast vs. Peer-to-Peer:** Misinformation could enter via **broadcast nodes** (e.g. a media outlet or social platform that reaches many agents at once) or via peer sharing. In one design, we inject fake news at a certain rate into the system (e.g. a climate denial article “goes viral” at time T) and any agent connected to the source may receive it. Those who adopt the false belief might then share it further with their neighbors in subsequent steps (a contagion model). Alternatively, we could seed a set of influencer agents who periodically spread misinformation to their followers.  

- **Network Topology:** Different network structures can be tested – e.g. **scale-free networks** to mimic social media (where a few influencers have very many connections), vs **small-world networks** or spatial grids to mimic community interactions. Network structure is known to affect misinformation spread; for instance, tightly-knit clusters can form **echo chambers** where falsehoods circulate with little outside correction. Research has shown that network clustering allows fake news to **resist correction efforts**, effectively doubling the resilience of false beliefs against fact-checking interventions ([Containing misinformation: Modeling spatial games of fake news | PNAS Nexus | Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/3/pgae090/7614685#:~:text=coordination%20game,sanctioners%20can%20help%20contain%20fake)). We expect that in a highly clustered network, pockets of extreme belief (e.g. climate denial) will persist longer and potentially continue influencing those agents’ investments despite contrary evidence.  

- **Truth vs. Falsehood Diffusion:** We can simulate both misinformation and corrective information spreading. For example, while some agents propagate a false narrative, others (or external events) might propagate factual information or debunks. This introduces a competition in the model: will truthful information penetrate before too many portfolios are misallocated? Prior studies note that false news often spreads **faster and wider than truth** on social media ([Containing misinformation: Modeling spatial games of fake news | PNAS Nexus | Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/3/pgae090/7614685#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20have%20sought%20to,truth%20in%20all%20categories%20of)), so our model might reflect this by giving misinformation a higher virality factor. We could include *fact-checker agents* or “inoculation” signals (as in real experiments that show preemptive warnings can reduce susceptibility ([The “Future of Energy”? Building resilience to ExxonMobil’s disinformation through disclosures and inoculation | npj Climate Action](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44168-025-00209-6#:~:text=Disinformation%20campaigns%20can%20significantly%20impact,These%20findings))) to see if that dampens the effect on beliefs and allocations.  

The outcome of interest here is the **diffusion pattern** of beliefs: does misinformation rapidly infect a large portion of individuals? Does it stabilize in equilibrium (everyone eventually hears it and either believes or not), or does it keep recirculating? And how does that correlate with investment patterns (e.g. a wave of fake news might trigger a wave of buying in a certain asset, analogous to a rally built on rumor)? By tweaking network connectivity or introducing/removing sanctioning agents (those who correct fake news), we can observe different regimes of spread and their market impacts. This component essentially models the **social contagion** of misinformation across investors.

### Feedback Loops from Portfolio Performance to Beliefs  
An optional but insightful extension is to allow the **outcomes of investment decisions to feed back into agents’ beliefs**. In reality, beliefs can be somewhat **adaptive**: people may learn from experience, especially if outcomes starkly contradict their expectations. The ABM can incorporate this by monitoring each agent’s portfolio performance and introducing rules like:  

- **Outcome-Based Belief Revision:** If an agent consistently experiences losses that are explainable by a misbelief, they might update their belief toward reality. For example, an individual deeply invested in fossil fuel stocks might reconsider their climate skepticism if those stocks tank repeatedly while renewable stocks surge. The model could implement this as a conditional increase in belief in climate risk after a threshold of underperformance is reached. This creates a negative feedback: severe market consequences of a false belief eventually reduce the prevalence of that belief.  

- **Wealth and Confirmation:** Conversely, if misinformed investors profit (at least in the short term), they could become **more entrenched**. An agent who denies climate change and then sees strong returns from coal industry stocks may treat that as validation of their stance (“see, climate risk was overblown, I made money”). The rule could be that if portfolio return exceeds some benchmark and the agent holds a contrarian belief, their confidence in that belief grows. This is plausible given human nature to attribute success to correct judgment. Such positive feedback might delay the day of reckoning for misinformation – it’s analogous to how a bubble can reinforce the false narrative that “this asset is a great investment” as long as prices keep rising.  

- **Institutional Feedback:** Institutional investors might also update their sentiment model based on outcomes. If the market consistently rewards dirty assets, even neutral institutions might start doubting the importance of climate risk (essentially adopting the crowd’s belief). On the flip side, if a bubble bursts, institutions could shift strategy en masse, which can swing sentiment rapidly.  

Including performance-to-belief feedback allows the model to endogenously show whether reality can puncture misinformation-driven market trends. A critical question is whether correction comes *too late* (after significant economic damage) or whether mild signals suffice to steer beliefs. This also connects to the idea of **investment churn**: agents learning the hard way might sell off misinformed positions (churn their portfolios) once losses materialize, potentially causing market volatility. Indeed, high disagreement among investors is linked to higher trading volume and can predict lower future returns ([Disagreement and Market Returns: Evidence from Institutional Investors' Portfolio Churn Rate  by Onur Bayar, Ivalina Kalcheva, Ping McLemore, Hasan Zafer Yuksel :: SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/Delivery.cfm/4937849.pdf?abstractid=4937849&mirid=1&type=2#:~:text=market%20returns,predictive%20power%20of%20APC%20is)), suggesting that when beliefs are in flux and contentious, the market may become less efficient and more prone to downturns. Our model can capture this by tracking trading frequencies and subsequent return patterns under various misinformation scenarios. 

In sum, the ABM’s structure couples a **belief evolution model** (driven by information spread and social influence) with a **market model** (agents allocating wealth to assets and experiencing gains/losses). By experimenting with different interaction logics – how agents update beliefs, how misinformation travels, and whether/when reality feeds back – we can observe a range of possible outcomes from stable equilibria to boom-bust cycles driven by waves of misinformation.

## Modeling Tools and Implementation Considerations  
Building an agent-based model with the above features requires choosing appropriate tools that facilitate customization of agent behavior, network interactions, and repeated simulation. Several modeling platforms are well-suited:

- **NetLogo:** A popular, user-friendly ABM environment that has become a *standard platform for developing ABMs* ([Reliable and Efficient Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation](https://www.jasss.org/27/2/4.html#:~:text=NetLogo%20is%20a%20free%20agent,The%20importance%20and)). NetLogo provides a simple programming language and a GUI for visualization, making it ideal for prototyping the model quickly. It has built-in support for agent properties and network links, and a BehaviorSpace utility for running experiments across parameter sweeps. Given NetLogo’s extensive community, we can leverage existing code snippets for social networks or contagion processes. The trade-off is performance – NetLogo can handle modest population sizes but may slow down with very large numbers of agents or very long simulations. For our purposes (exploratory conceptual model), NetLogo is a strong starting choice, allowing interactive tweaks to rules (e.g. flipping a switch to turn feedback on/off) and immediate visualization of phenomena like clusters of believers/deniers and the resulting market price movements.

- **Mesa (Python):** Mesa is an open-source ABM framework in Python, offering a good balance between ease of use and flexibility ([Reliable and Efficient Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation](https://www.jasss.org/27/2/4.html#:~:text=ease%20of%20use%2C%20like%20NetLogo,executions%20while%20still%20granting%20an)). Implementing the model in Mesa would allow more complex data handling, integration with scientific libraries (NumPy, pandas for analysis; NetworkX for advanced network structures; etc.), and easier output of results for statistical analysis. Python also makes it easier to implement custom processes (like event-study analysis of market shocks, or plugging in a Bayesian update function). Mesa’s design supports grid or network space and has a browser-based visualization as well. Using Mesa could be advantageous for scaling up the number of agents or running many simulations in batch (especially since we could run headless simulations and use Python’s multiprocessing). In comparison to NetLogo, Mesa requires more coding effort but is far more extensible – important if we later integrate empirical data or more sophisticated agent decision rules.

- **Repast (Java/Python):** Repast is a robust, mature ABM toolkit that can handle large-scale simulations and has been used frequently for economic and social modeling. Repast Simphony (Java-based) or Repast for Python (Repast4Py) would be suitable if we want to emphasize performance and possibly integrate with databases or HPC environments. Repast offers rich scheduling, integration with GIS, and even flow between system dynamics and agents. Given that NetLogo and Mesa prioritize simplicity and quick development ([Reliable and Efficient Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation](https://www.jasss.org/27/2/4.html#:~:text=ease%20of%20use%2C%20like%20NetLogo,executions%20while%20still%20granting%20an)), Repast stands out for scenarios where we might simulate tens of thousands of agents or need complex event scheduling. However, for a conceptual research model, the overhead of Java (or the learning curve of Repast4Py) might not be necessary. Still, if the project grows (for example, to simulate an entire stock market with heterogeneous investors in detail), Repast’s performance optimizations could be useful. We mention it as an option, especially since it supports both discrete-event and time-step simulations, which could allow mixing faster processes (trading) with slower ones (belief change).

- **Custom Python Simulation:** Instead of a full ABM framework, we could implement the model from scratch in Python (or R/Julia). This would give maximum flexibility – for example, coding the belief network update as matrix operations for speed, or implementing the market as an order book model if desired. Python’s scientific stack would let us easily do things like draw random social networks (using NetworkX or other network-generation libraries), simulate trading with random processes, and analyze distributions of outcomes. Visualization could be done via matplotlib or seaborn for static outputs, or even interactive dashboards with something like Bokeh. The downside is reinventing features that ABM frameworks already provide (like agent scheduling, space management). A custom simulation might be warranted if the model demands a very unique structure (e.g. coupling to an external financial model) or if we want to integrate reinforcement learning agents, etc. It also allows leveraging domain-specific libraries (for instance, using **OpenAI Gym** environments or other reinforcement learning frameworks if we let agents learn strategies). 

In practice, the choice might be a two-step approach: quickly prototype in **NetLogo** to validate basic dynamics and intuition (NetLogo’s ease-of-use helps in communicating the model as well), then implement a more detailed version in **Mesa/Python** for extensive experiments and sensitivity analysis. Mesa’s Python base also allows using modern tools like Jupyter notebooks for analyzing results, which is beneficial in a research context.

Regardless of the tool, careful attention will be paid to **modularity** in the model implementation: we want to toggle components (e.g. turn misinformation on or off, compare static vs dynamic beliefs, etc.), so the framework chosen should allow clear separation of the belief-update module, the network module, and the market module. Tools like NetLogo and Mesa naturally support this with their agent-oriented design.

## Related Work and Literature Context  
This project builds on insights from existing research in several domains: behavioral finance, misinformation diffusion, and agent-based modeling of markets and social processes. We summarize a few key strands of literature that inform our approach and expectations:

- **Belief-Driven Financial Behavior:** Traditional finance theory assumes homogeneous rational expectations, but many studies document how heterogeneous beliefs and biases drive market anomalies ([Hiroshi Takahashi and Takao Terano: Investors' Behavior in 
Financial Markets
](https://www.jasss.org/6/3/3.html#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20use,1)) ([Hiroshi Takahashi and Takao Terano: Investors' Behavior in 
Financial Markets
](https://www.jasss.org/6/3/3.html#:~:text=financial%20theories%20including%20CAPM%20have,the%20validity%20of%20their%20assumptions)). Notably, **behavioral finance** models have shown that when irrational or biased agents are present, they can significantly impact prices. Takahashi & Terano (2003) developed an ABM with fundamentalist vs. trend-following investors, finding that if non-fundamental “trend” investors dominate, **prices deviate from fundamental values and those trend-chasers can earn excess returns**, even pushing rational investors out of the market ([Hiroshi Takahashi and Takao Terano: Investors' Behavior in 
Financial Markets
](https://www.jasss.org/6/3/3.html#:~:text=the%20traded%20price%20largely%20deviates,extremely%20high%20or%20in%20the)). This supports the notion that a group of misinformed or biased traders (analogous to our climate-denying investors) could not only distort the market but also, in some conditions, *thrive* in the short term. Related theoretical work on heterogeneous beliefs (e.g. by Andrew Abel and others) suggests that greater **belief dispersion can inflate asset prices** and increase volatility ([Asset Prices Under Heterogenous Beliefs: Implications for the Equity ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5071317_Asset_Prices_Under_Heterogenous_Beliefs_Implications_for_the_Equity_Premium#:~:text=,)). Our model taps into this by explicitly coding belief dispersion via misinformation and observing its effect on market-level outcomes like price volatility and sector bubbles.

- **Misinformation and Markets:** Empirical evidence confirms that misinformation can move markets, at least temporarily. A 2023 study by Arcuri *et al.* showed that **fake news can cause stock prices to react even when the content is false**, due to investor disagreement or confusion ([Does fake news impact stock returns? Evidence from US and EU stock markets](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jebusi/v125-126y2023is0148619523000231.html#:~:text=fabricated%20and%20meant%20to%20mislead,neutral%20news%20items%20do%20not)). They found negative fake news yields significantly negative short-term returns for targeted stocks ([Does fake news impact stock returns? Evidence from US and EU stock markets](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jebusi/v125-126y2023is0148619523000231.html#:~:text=to%20respond%20to%20the%20fake,neutral%20news%20items%20do%20not)) – essentially, markets *do* respond to false headlines. This phenomenon underpins our model’s assumption that agents will trade on misinformation-influenced beliefs, leading to real price impacts. Another study on misinformation in finance noted that the **spread of false news is a form of market manipulation** that exploits investors’ inability to verify information quickly ([Does fake news impact stock returns? Evidence from US and EU stock markets](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jebusi/v125-126y2023is0148619523000231.html#:~:text=fabricated%20and%20meant%20to%20mislead,neutral%20news%20items%20do%20not)). Beyond single stocks, broad narratives (like climate change denial or economic conspiracy theories) can also sway investor sentiment. Historical episodes, such as false reports that triggered flash crashes ([False White House tweet exposes instant trading dangers - Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/false-white-house-tweet-exposes-instant-trading-dangers-idUSBRE93M1FE/#:~:text=Reuters%20www,Barack%20Obama%20had%20been%20injured)), illustrate the potency of rapid misinformation. We also draw on the literature about **investor attention** and media – e.g. how news (real or fake) drives trading volume and volatility. If fake news increases disagreement, one measurable outcome is higher trading turnover. Consistent with this, recent research found that periods of high **portfolio churn among institutional investors (a proxy for disagreement) predict lower future returns**, likely reflecting the destabilizing effect of conflicting beliefs ([Disagreement and Market Returns: Evidence from Institutional Investors' Portfolio Churn Rate  by Onur Bayar, Ivalina Kalcheva, Ping McLemore, Hasan Zafer Yuksel :: SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/Delivery.cfm/4937849.pdf?abstractid=4937849&mirid=1&type=2#:~:text=market%20returns,predictive%20power%20of%20APC%20is)). In our model, we expect misinformation to create such disagreement-driven trading, and we can check if increased churn or volatility emerges as a result.

- **Investment Culture Wars (ESG and Climate Politics):** The divide in beliefs about climate change and ESG investing has become a subject of financial research as well. Papers and reports have noted that some public officials and institutions, influenced by climate skepticism or political motives, have made investment choices that ignore material climate risks – sometimes at a cost to performance ([Anti-ESG laws hurting Texas economically, unpopular with voters](https://www.esgdive.com/news/anti-esg-laws-hurting-texas-economically-unpopular-with-votersuaf/716741/#:~:text=voters%20www,next%2030%20years%2C%20UAF)). The **ESG backlash** narrative (e.g. “climate risk is not real, focus only on returns”) serves as a real-world example of institutional behavior our model tries to capture. For instance, one analysis by a Texas state agency (2024) highlighted that anti-ESG laws led to **higher financing costs (hundreds of millions of dollars) for state entities** ([
        Texas lawmakers, Houston controller say anti-ESG law is government overreach | S&P Global
    ](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2024/10/texas-lawmakers-houston-controller-say-anti-esg-law-is-government-overreach-83371504#:~:text=state%20have%20paid%20%24270%20million,was%20enacted%20three%20years%20ago)), essentially a case of belief-driven financial decision (ignoring ESG) leading to measurable loss. These findings underscore why it’s important to model how widespread denial or misinformation could impair not just individual portfolios but broader financial stability. They provide calibration points – e.g. if our model shows climate-denying agents ignoring clean investments, we might compare the outcome (like underinvestment in certain sectors) to empirical observations of capital flows in regions with high denial versus low denial.

- **Greenwashing and Trust:** Literature in sustainable finance has started to quantify the effects of companies’ misleading claims on investors. As noted, Akyildirim *et al.* (2024) found a significant negative market reaction when firms are outed for **greenwashing** ([Greenwashing: Do Investors, Markets, and Boards Really Care? | CLS Blue Sky Blog](https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2024/11/07/greenwashing-do-investors-markets-and-boards-really-care/#:~:text=To%20investigate%20the%20effects%20of,face%20heightened%20volatility%20and%20significant)). This highlights that while misinformation may attract investment initially, the correction can be abrupt and costly. Our model’s exploration of a greenwashing scenario is informed by such studies – we anticipate seeing something similar (agents flock to a “greenwashed” asset, but once a certain fraction learn the truth, a sell-off occurs). Moreover, experimental studies (e.g. via surveys ([Aggregate confusion or inner conflict? An experimental analysis of ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1544612322005980#:~:text=,is%20perceived%20by%20retail%20investors))) show that retail investors can be swayed by green labels and may not detect greenwashing easily, which justifies including this dimension of misinformation in our model scope.

- **Agent-Based Models of Misinformation:** From a methodology standpoint, we build on a body of ABM research examining misinformation spread. Some works use **epidemic models or game-theoretic models** on networks to study fake news propagation ([Containing misinformation: Modeling spatial games of fake news | PNAS Nexus | Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/3/pgae090/7614685#:~:text=The%20spread%20of%20fake%20news,as%20well%20as%20initial%20conditions)). For example, recent studies have looked at how introducing “inoculator” agents or sanctioning fake-news spreaders can contain misinformation ([Containing misinformation: Modeling spatial games of fake news | PNAS Nexus | Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/3/pgae090/7614685#:~:text=individuals%20who%20sanction%20fake%20news,Furthermore%2C%20we%20analytically%20determine%20the)). These models often find that network structure (clustering, presence of zealot nodes, etc.) crucially determines outcomes – e.g., dense echo chambers can sustain false beliefs even under moderate correction pressure ([Containing misinformation: Modeling spatial games of fake news | PNAS Nexus | Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/3/pgae090/7614685#:~:text=coordination%20game,sanctioners%20can%20help%20contain%20fake)). We incorporate these insights by allowing network topology to be varied and by possibly adding truth-teller agents in some simulations to see if misinformation-induced market effects can be curtailed. Our approach is novel in tying such a social network fake-news model to a financial market simulation (most prior ABMs either focus on misinformation spread *or* on market dynamics, but not both together). By bridging them, we hope to contribute to both literatures: showing how misinformation dynamics can translate into macro-financial patterns.

- **Behavior of Individual Investors:** Finally, our model echoes known behaviors of retail investors as documented by Barber, Odean, and others. They find that individual investors are often overconfident, trade too frequently, and make decisions influenced by recent news or personal beliefs, often with suboptimal results ([The Behavior of Individual Investors](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers%20current%20versions/behavior%20of%20individual%20investors.pdf#:~:text=perfor%02mance%20trade%20more,outperform%20the%20portfolios%20of%20households)) ([[PDF] The Behavior of Individual Investors - Meet the Berkeley-Haas Faculty](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers%20current%20versions/behavior%20of%20individual%20investors.pdf#:~:text=,more%20than%20twice%20per%20year)). The classic “Trading is Hazardous to Your Wealth” study (Barber & Odean 2000) showed that the most active traders (potentially those chasing news) significantly underperform. This underpins our interest in **investment churn** as an outcome – if misinformation causes some agents to rapidly shift allocations with each new false rumor, the model may reproduce that high-turnover, low-return pattern. We will compare our simulation outputs (e.g. distribution of returns among agents) with empirical benchmarks from such studies to see if misinformed agents indeed fare worse on average, and conversely whether agents who resist misinformation (or institutions who stick to fundamentals) achieve better outcomes – aligning with real investor performance disparities.

In summary, the concept and design of this agent-based model are grounded in existing research that shows: (a) beliefs and misinformation can significantly sway financial decisions, (b) agent-based simulations are a useful tool to capture these complex social-market interactions, and (c) there are real-world analogues (climate denial campaigns, ESG backlash, viral stock tips) where these dynamics play out. By drawing these threads together, our proposed model will provide a structured way to experiment with “what-if” scenarios – for example, *What if a large portion of the population is convinced climate change is a hoax? How does capital allocation to fossil fuels vs renewables evolve? Could this create a market bubble?* – and to test potential interventions (like information campaigns or policy regulations) in silico. We see this work as contributing to better understanding the risks of misinformation in economic systems and guiding future empirical analysis of belief-driven market behavior.

## Conclusion and Next Steps  
This research plan outlines a comprehensive **agent-based modeling approach** to study the impact of fake news on investment decisions, with a focus on climate denialism as a salient example. The structured summary above covered the core idea (that belief shifts from misinformation can lead to misallocation such as fossil fuel overexposure), additional dimensions (ranging from economic rumors to greenwashing and ESG politics), possible model designs (belief updating, misinformation diffusion, feedback loops), appropriate tools for implementation (NetLogo, Mesa, Repast, etc.), and relevant literature grounding the model’s components. 

**Next Steps:** Going forward, the next step will be to formally implement a prototype of the model and perform initial experiments. Key tasks include: (1) defining quantitative metrics for outcomes (e.g. measure of portfolio carbon intensity over time, market price deviation from fundamental value, wealth distribution effects, frequency of portfolio reallocations), (2) running the model under various scenarios (e.g. no misinformation vs sustained misinformation campaigns) to observe differences, and (3) validating the model behavior against real-world observations or stylized facts from the literature (for instance, checking that when misinformation is absent, the model behaves like a normal efficient market, and when present, it reproduces known phenomena like bubbles or increased volatility). We will also conduct sensitivity analyses on parameters such as network connectivity, strength of fake news influence, and fraction of institutional investors, to see how robust the insights are. Ultimately, the goal is to derive conclusions about how dangerous misinformation can be to financial stability and what mechanisms (education, policy, network interventions) might mitigate those risks. By iterating between the model results and empirical data, we aim to refine the model and increase its realism, making this a solid foundation for a research paper on **belief-driven market dynamics in the age of misinformation**.
