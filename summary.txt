This is an agent-based model simulating how fake news affects investment decisions related to climate
  change. Here's what it does:

  Agents:

  - 50 Individual Investors: Start with random beliefs about climate risk (0 = denier, 1 = strong
  believer)
    - Their portfolio allocation follows their beliefs (higher belief → more "Green" investments, less
  "Fossil")
    - They're susceptible to fake news to varying degrees
  - 10 Institutional Investors: Follow market sentiment (the average belief of individuals)
    - They adjust portfolios based on what the crowd thinks

  Simulation Process:

  Each step:
  1. News injection: With 10% probability, news is broadcasted
    - 50% chance it's "fake denial" news (decreases climate risk belief)
    - 50% chance it's "real climate" news (increases belief)
  2. Belief updates: Individual investors update their beliefs based on news
  3. Portfolio reallocation: All agents adjust their Green vs Fossil holdings
  4. Data collection: Tracks average beliefs, portfolio allocations, and market sentiment

  What you saw:

  The beliefs stayed constant (0.518447) across all 20 steps, which suggests either:
  - No news was injected during those 20 steps (10% chance per step is fairly low)
  - The news impact was too small to significantly move the average

  The model demonstrates how misinformation can influence investment markets and capital flows between
  green/fossil fuel assets. Would you like to run it with more steps or higher news injection rates to see
   more dynamic behavior?





FAKE NEWS


  How Fake News Enters the Model

  Step 1: News Injection (model.py:146-155)

  Each timestep, the model decides whether to inject news:

  if random.random() < self.news_injection_rate:  # 30% chance per step
      news_strength = random.uniform(0.05, 0.15)  # Random strength 5-15%

      if random.random() < self.fake_news_proportion:  # 50% of news is fake
          news_type = "fake_denial"  # Fake news denying climate risk
      else:
          news_type = "real_climate"  # Real news about climate risk

      # Broadcast to all individual investors
      for agent in self.agents:
          if isinstance(agent, IndividualInvestor):
              self.current_news[id(agent)] = (news_type, news_strength)

  Example: At step 5, there's a 30% chance news appears. If it does, there's a 50% chance it's
  "fake_denial" with strength 0.12

  Step 2: Individual Investors Process News (agents.py:57-70)

  Each individual investor checks if they received news and updates their belief:

  Fake News ("fake_denial") - DECREASES belief:

  change = news_strength * susceptibility * (1 - current_belief)
  new_belief = current_belief - change

  Example:
  - Agent has belief = 0.6 (60% believes climate is risky)
  - News strength = 0.12
  - Susceptibility = 0.8 (very susceptible to misinformation)
  - Change = 0.12 × 0.8 × (1 - 0.6) = 0.0384
  - New belief = 0.6 - 0.0384 = 0.5616 ⬇️

  Real News ("real_climate") - INCREASES belief:

  change = news_strength * (1 - susceptibility) * current_belief
  new_belief = current_belief + change

  Example:
  - Agent has belief = 0.4
  - News strength = 0.10
  - Susceptibility = 0.3 (less susceptible = more receptive to real news)
  - Change = 0.10 × (1 - 0.3) × 0.4 = 0.028
  - New belief = 0.4 + 0.028 = 0.428 ⬆️

  Step 3: Portfolio Reallocation (agents.py:73-83)

  Beliefs directly translate to portfolio:
  portfolio['Green'] = belief_climate_risk
  portfolio['Fossil'] = 1.0 - belief_climate_risk

  Key Insights:

  1. Higher susceptibility = more affected by fake news, less by real news
  2. News strength varies randomly (5-15%), so impact differs each time
  3. Institutional investors don't receive news directly - they just follow the average belief of
  individuals
  4. Only 30% of steps have news, so many steps show no change

  Why the graphs show gradual decline:

  Looking at your simulation, beliefs declined from ~0.52 to ~0.51 because:
  - 30% chance × 50% fake = 15% of steps had fake news
  - 30% chance × 50% real = 15% of steps had real news
  - The fake news slightly outweighed real news due to random variation
